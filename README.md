   - Deploy the artifacts to your Nginx server. Ensure that the server is properly configured to serve the application.

## * Using Private IP on the Backend VM 🌐

To use a Private IP on the Backend VM, follow the steps below:

### 1. Configure NGINX on the Backend VM ⚙️

Open the NGINX configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

### 2. Insert Proxy Configuration 🔄

Copy and paste the following code just above the `root /var/www/html` line:

```nginx
location /api {
   proxy_pass http://<PrivateIP of BackendVM>:8000;
   proxy_set_header Host $host;
   proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

Replace `<PrivateIP of BackendVM>` with the actual Private IP address of your Backend VM.

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration ⚙️

Open the `src/TodoApp.js` file in your frontend project.

Update the Backend URL by replacing the existing line with the following:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://<FrontendVM Public IP>:80/api';
```

Replace `<FrontendVM Public IP>` with the actual Public IP address of your Frontend VM.

## Important Note 📌

Make sure to restart NGINX on the VM after making the changes:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

These configurations enable communication between the Frontend and Backend using Private IP on the Backend VM. Ensure that the IPs and ports are correctly set to match your environment.
